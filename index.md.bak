# <a name="description">Objectives</a>

  Electrical Energy plays a significant role in day-to-day life of entire mankind. This course deals with the generation of power along with its economic aspects. It deals with the basic theory of various conventional power stations and the different components present in them. The course also helps the students to familiarize with different types of substations and its advantages and disadvantages. It also deals with the economic aspects of power system, power factor correction techniques and suitable pricing methods.

# Coursework

Inform the instructor any time *prior* to the due date for an assignment
that you wish to use a late day; you may then turn in the assignment up to 24
hours late. Multiple late days may be used on the same assignment. There are no
partial late days; turning in an assignment 2 hours late or 20 hours late will
both use 1 late day. Note that late days are intended to cover both normal
circumstances (you simply want more time to work on the assignment) and
exceptional circumstances. The late assignments will receive at most half credit.
